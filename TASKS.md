# TASKS.md — SmartGarden AI

> Granular, checkbox-level task tracker mirroring `ROADMAP.md`. This is the file to update **during** a session as work happens, and to check **at the start** of a session to know exactly where things stopped.
>
> **Rules for using this file:**
> - Check a box the moment the task is actually done (code written *and* verified running/compiling), not when merely started.
> - If a phase is split (see `ROADMAP.md` sizing note), split its section here too (e.g. `Phase 9a`, `Phase 9b`).
> - Never delete completed sections — this file is the project's build log. Strike through only if a task became obsolete, and say why in a short inline note.
> - Keep "Current Status" at the top accurate — it is the first thing a new session should read.

## Current Status

- **Active phase:** Phase 6 — Preview & AI Loading Animation
- **Status:** Not started
- **Last session summary:** Phase 5 completed on 2026-07-10. Added `services/storage/image_storage_service.dart` (`ImageStorageService`, copies raw camera/gallery temp files into `<app documents>/scans/`, returns a stable path). Built minimal domain+data layers for `camera` (`CameraCaptureRepository`/`Impl`, `StoreCapturedPhoto`) and `gallery` (`GalleryRepository`/`Impl`, `StorePickedPhoto`), both prefixing filenames (`camera_`/`gallery_`) via the shared storage service. Built `CameraScreen` (live `CameraController` preview, capture button, app-lifecycle-aware dispose/reinit, permission-denial error state, immersive black chrome). Gallery picking uses `image_picker`'s native OS picker directly — no dedicated screen — invoked from the new `scan_source_sheet.dart` M3 bottom sheet wired to Home's "Scan a Plant" CTA. Both flows push a new temporary `PreviewScreen` (image + sandboxed path + Retake; intentionally minimal, `TODO(Phase 6)`'d for the real version). Declared `CAMERA` permission (Android manifest) and `NSCameraUsageDescription`/`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (iOS Info.plist). Wired new use cases into `app.dart`'s `MultiProvider` and added `/camera`+`/preview` routes. `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` still 16/16 (no new tests — plugin-driven UI, not unit-testable domain logic). Verified live end-to-end on the Android emulator in both themes: full Camera flow (permission prompt → grant → live preview → capture → correct sandbox path shown on Preview → Retake resumes a warm camera) and full Gallery flow (native Photo Picker → selection → correct sandbox path shown on Preview → Retake returns to Home).
- **Next action:** Begin Phase 6 — Preview & AI Loading Animation per `ROADMAP.md` (replace the Phase-5 placeholder `PreviewScreen` with the real Preview screen — Retake/Confirm actions, `Hero` continuity from Camera/Gallery — and build the branded AI Loading screen that Confirm transitions into, calling into `AIService` with a stub result if Phase 7 hasn't landed yet).
