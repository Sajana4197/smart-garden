# TASKS.md — SmartGarden AI

> Granular, checkbox-level task tracker mirroring `ROADMAP.md`. This is the file to update **during** a session as work happens, and to check **at the start** of a session to know exactly where things stopped.
>
> **Rules for using this file:**
> - Check a box the moment the task is actually done (code written *and* verified running/compiling), not when merely started.
> - If a phase is split (see `ROADMAP.md` sizing note), split its section here too (e.g. `Phase 9a`, `Phase 9b`).
> - Never delete completed sections — this file is the project's build log. Strike through only if a task became obsolete, and say why in a short inline note.
> - Keep "Current Status" at the top accurate — it is the first thing a new session should read.

## Current Status

- **Active phase:** Phase 11 — Weather Integration
- **Status:** Not started
- **Last session summary:** Phase 10 completed on 2026-07-11. Domain: `GetAllScans` (thin `ScanRepository` wrapper, mirrors `GetAllPlants`) and `GetPlantById` (thin `PlantRepository` wrapper, new — needed so Scan Detail can resolve a linked scan's plant for its "View in My Garden" action). Presentation: `ScanHistoryProvider` (loads the full scan list once; holds in-memory sort order — newest/oldest — and two filters — severity and linked/unlinked — recomputing a derived `scans` getter on every read rather than re-querying the DB per filter change), a `ScanFilterBar` widget (`SegmentedButton` for link filter, a sort-direction `IconButton`, horizontally-scrolling `ChoiceChip` row for severity), a rebuilt `ScanHistoryScreen` (reverse-chronological list, thumbnail + label + date + severity badge + "Not saved to My Garden" for unlinked scans, empty states for "no scans at all" vs. "no scans match filters"), and a new `ScanDetailScreen` that extends `ResultScreen`'s presentation (hero image, diagnosis, confidence bar, description, symptoms) by reconstructing the full `PlantDiagnosisResult` from `scans.raw_result_json` via `jsonDecode`+`PlantDiagnosisResult.fromJson` rather than re-deriving it from the flattened columns. Scan Detail's footer action depends on link state: unlinked scans get "Save to My Garden" (identical flow/dialog to Result); linked scans get "View in My Garden" instead (resolves the plant via `GetPlantById` and pushes `/my-garden/detail`), since re-saving would create a duplicate plant. New `/scan-history/detail` route. `ScanHistoryProvider` is registered app-wide in `app.dart` (not screen-scoped) for the exact `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` reason documented for `MyGardenProvider` in Phase 9 (CLAUDE.md §3) — Scan History is a bottom-nav branch whose subtree survives tab switches without rebuilding, so a screen-local provider would never see scans added afterward. `AiLoadingScreen` now calls `context.read<ScanHistoryProvider>().loadScans()` right after persisting a new scan (same "explicit refresh after the mutating action" pattern as Phase 9), and `PlantDetailScreen`'s per-plant scan history tiles now push `/scan-history/detail` too, so Scan Detail is reachable from both entry points. `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` 16/16 (no test changes — Phase 10 added no new repository logic beyond thin use-case wrappers over already-tested `ScanRepositoryImpl`/`PlantRepositoryImpl`). Verified live end-to-end on the Android emulator: Scan History lists all scans since Phase 7 (both linked and unlinked) in reverse-chronological order; the "Unlinked" + "Linked" `SegmentedButton` filter and severity `ChoiceChip` filter compose correctly together; the sort-direction toggle updates its icon; tapping a scan opens Scan Detail with the diagnosis correctly reconstructed from `raw_result_json`; "View in My Garden" on a linked scan navigates to the correct `PlantDetailScreen` (confirmed its Scan History section shows the linked scan); "Save to My Garden" on an unlinked scan opens the same dialog as Result, and on save both `MyGardenProvider` (new tile appears in My Garden immediately) and `ScanHistoryProvider` refresh (the just-saved scan immediately drops out of the "Unlinked" filter view) with no app restart required.
- **Next action:** Begin Phase 11 — Weather Integration per `ROADMAP.md` (REST client, API key via `--dart-define`, location permission flow, domain models for current conditions/short forecast, wire Home Dashboard's weather card to live data, graceful offline/error/permission-denied fallback with cached last value).
