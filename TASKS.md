# TASKS.md — SmartGarden AI

> Granular, checkbox-level task tracker mirroring `ROADMAP.md`. This is the file to update **during** a session as work happens, and to check **at the start** of a session to know exactly where things stopped.
>
> **Rules for using this file:**
> - Check a box the moment the task is actually done (code written *and* verified running/compiling), not when merely started.
> - If a phase is split (see `ROADMAP.md` sizing note), split its section here too (e.g. `Phase 9a`, `Phase 9b`).
> - Never delete completed sections — this file is the project's build log. Strike through only if a task became obsolete, and say why in a short inline note.
> - Keep "Current Status" at the top accurate — it is the first thing a new session should read.

## Current Status

- **Active phase:** Phase 8 — Recommendation Engine
- **Status:** Not started
- **Last session summary:** Phase 7 completed on 2026-07-11. Implemented the `AIService` contract (`lib/services/ai/ai_service.dart`: `analyzeImage`/`isReady`, `AIServiceException`/`AIServiceErrorType`) and `PlantDiagnosisResult`/`DiagnosisSeverity` (`lib/services/ai/models/plant_diagnosis_result.dart`, with `toJson`/`fromJson`/`copyWith`) per `MODEL_INTEGRATION.md` §2–3. Built `MockAIService` (1.5–3s simulated latency, optional `forcedResultIndex` test hook, optional `failureProbability` for simulated errors, defaults to 0) drawing from a curated `mockResultBank` (2 healthy cases + 6 disease cases across 6 species — Tomato, Basil, Rose, Pepper, Cucumber, Monstera — spanning mild/moderate/severe). Wired `AIService` and `ScanRepository` into `app.dart`'s `MultiProvider`. Rewrote `AiLoadingScreen` to call the real `AIService.analyzeImage()`, persist the completed scan via `ScanRepository.addScan()` (mapping `DiagnosisSeverity` → `ScanSeverity` by name, `PlantDiagnosisResult.toJson()` → `raw_result_json`), and handle `AIServiceException` with an inline error state (title per `AIServiceErrorType`, Try Again retry) instead of a raw exception. Rewrote `ResultScreen` (+ new `ResultScreenArgs` transport class for the `/result` route's `extra`) with hero image, diagnosis label, `AppStatusBadge` (severity mapped to `AppHealthStatus`, `none`→`healthy`), animated confidence bar (`TweenAnimationBuilder`), description, and a bulleted "What we noticed" visual-symptoms list (hidden when empty, e.g. the Healthy case). `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` 16/16 (no test changes this phase). Verified live end-to-end on the Android emulator in both themes: Home → Camera (Take Photo, emulator synthetic feed) → Preview → Confirm → AI Loading (real mock latency + sweep animation) → Result, twice with different randomized outcomes (Pepper/Aphid Infestation/Mild/82% and Tomato/Healthy/97% with symptoms list correctly hidden) → Back to Home. Confirmed via `adb run-as` + pulling `smart_garden.db` that the scan row was persisted correctly (`diagnosis_label`, `severity`, `confidence`, full `raw_result_json` matching the served result). One environment note: the Android emulator hung completely (qemu process alive but non-responsive, near-zero CPU) mid-session and had to be force-killed and relaunched fresh — not an app issue.
- **Next action:** Begin Phase 8 — Recommendation Engine per `ROADMAP.md` (domain rule-based mapping from `diagnosisLabel`/`severity` → structured recommendation covering watering/light/treatment/urgency, a local curated content bank covering all 8 Phase 7 mock outcomes, a Recommendation screen/section linked from Result, verifying every mock diagnosis outcome yields a sensible non-empty recommendation with no "no data" fallback needed).
