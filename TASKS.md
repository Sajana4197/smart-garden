# TASKS.md — SmartGarden AI

> Granular, checkbox-level task tracker mirroring `ROADMAP.md`. This is the file to update **during** a session as work happens, and to check **at the start** of a session to know exactly where things stopped.
>
> **Rules for using this file:**
> - Check a box the moment the task is actually done (code written *and* verified running/compiling), not when merely started.
> - If a phase is split (see `ROADMAP.md` sizing note), split its section here too (e.g. `Phase 9a`, `Phase 9b`).
> - Never delete completed sections — this file is the project's build log. Strike through only if a task became obsolete, and say why in a short inline note.
> - Keep "Current Status" at the top accurate — it is the first thing a new session should read.

## Current Status

- **Active phase:** Phase 12 — Daily Plant Tips
- **Status:** Not started
- **Last session summary:** Phase 11 completed on 2026-07-12. Weather API provider locked in as OpenWeatherMap (Current Weather Data + 5 day/3-hour Forecast endpoints), API key supplied via `--dart-define=WEATHER_API_KEY=...` and read through `core/constants/weather_config.dart`'s `String.fromEnvironment` (never hardcoded/committed). Domain (`features/weather/domain/`): `GeoPosition`, `CurrentWeather`/`WeatherCondition`, `ForecastDay`, `WeatherSnapshot` entities; `LocationRepository` (+ `LocationException`/`LocationErrorType`: permissionDenied, permissionDeniedForever, serviceDisabled) and `WeatherRepository` (+ `WeatherException`/`WeatherErrorType`: notConfigured, network) interfaces; `GetCurrentWeather` (location → live fetch) and `GetCachedWeather` use cases. Data: `WeatherRemoteDataSource` (http calls to both OWM endpoints), `ForecastDayModel.fromOpenWeatherForecastJson` (groups the forecast's 3-hour entries by calendar date, collapsing each to min/max temp + a midday-closest condition), `WeatherLocalDataSource` (shared_preferences cache of the last successful snapshot — the offline-resilience cache PROJECT_SPEC.md §6 requires), `WeatherRepositoryImpl` (fetches live + caches on success), `LocationRepositoryImpl` (wraps `geolocator`, bounded by a 10s timeout so a slow/stuck platform call can never hang the UI — see CLAUDE.md §3). Presentation: `WeatherProvider` (app-wide, same `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` reasoning as `MyGardenProvider`/`ScanHistoryProvider`; tracks `snapshot`, `isFromCache`, and a `WeatherDegradedReason?`) and `WeatherCard` (replaces Phase 3's static placeholder on Home Dashboard) with three render states: loading, a snapshot (live or cached, with an inline offline/permission badge in the latter case), or a fully degraded empty state with a context-appropriate action (retry / grant access / open Settings via `Geolocator.openAppSettings()`/`openLocationSettings()`). Added Android (`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `INTERNET`) and iOS (`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`) permission declarations — no `permission_handler` dependency, `geolocator` triggers the native OS prompt itself, matching the Camera/Gallery precedent (CLAUDE.md §3). **Bug caught and fixed during live verification**: `WeatherProvider.loadWeather()` originally only caught `LocationException`/`WeatherException`; any other exception (confirmed live: a `MissingPluginException`-class failure in the widget-test sandbox, surfaced as a real `flutter test` failure — `pumpAndSettle timed out`) left `degradedReason` null while `snapshot` was also null, and `WeatherCard` did `provider.degradedReason!` in that branch, crashing the build. Fixed with a catch-all `catch (_)` that defaults to the network-degraded state, and added the location-repository timeout above as defense in depth. `flutter analyze` clean; `flutter test` 16/16 (all passing after the fix — the widget tests build the real `SmartGardenApp` including `WeatherProvider`'s eager `loadWeather()`, so this fix was required for the existing suite, not just new coverage). Verified live end-to-end on the Android emulator with a real, user-supplied OpenWeatherMap API key: the native OS location-permission prompt appears correctly; the `serviceDisabled` fallback ("Turn on location services to see local weather," tappable → `openLocationSettings()`) and `network` fallback ("Couldn't reach the weather service") both render correctly (the latter caught a real-world case live — see below); and live weather ("Colombo · broken clouds · 28°C") renders correctly once location + connectivity were both available, matching a direct `curl` fetch of the same OpenWeatherMap endpoint byte-for-byte. **Notable finding, not a code bug**: mid-session the live fetch failed with `HandshakeException: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`; root-caused (via temporary debug logging, since removed) to the dev machine's Avast antivirus intercepting all system-wide HTTPS traffic including the emulator's NATed connection (confirmed by fetching `google.com` and seeing an Avast-issued certificate instead of Google's) — Dart's HTTP client correctly rejected the untrusted injected certificate. This is almost certainly the same root cause as Phase 1's `google_fonts` `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` note in CLAUDE.md §3. Resolved for this session by the user temporarily disabling Avast's Web Shield, after which the live-data path was confirmed working end-to-end.
- **Next action:** Begin Phase 12 — Daily Plant Tips per `ROADMAP.md` (local tip bank JSON asset, deterministic date-seeded tip selection, `daily_tip_state` persistence so the tip is stable within a calendar day and changes the next, wire Home Dashboard's tip card to the live daily tip in place of the current static placeholder, optional "All Tips" browse screen).
